                    <h1>More about me</h1>
                    <p>
                      So far I've been enjoying myself in Laurea and Vantaa a lot. I moved into Vantaa from the insignificant little town of Nummela in Vihti. The difference between the town and the city is massive and the amount of people still makes me nervous. This background picture was taken by me with my own camera when I was hunting moose with my grandfather at Pohjanmaa. We took a detour to see if a local wounded and fligthless swan was taking refuge on the pond in the photo. It was and it is in the photo, but my phones' camera couldn't get a clear picture of it due to the long distance so it is only a small blur of four pixels.

                    <h1>About my skills</h1>
                    <p>
                        More specifically, my skills that have to do with the bachelor's degree programme. I've passed high school and have several months worth of work experience in customer service. I am fairly talented in mathematics, though far from a progidy. I have studied programming a little bit before and during my service in the army. Other than that, I have nothing to give me an advantage in my studies. Instead, I have considerably more time left than others, so I just have to study hard and make this the base of my skills and knowledge.
