This is my blog, that I made for an HTML course in university. It was made in the span of about a week. In this blog I will tell about my skills and ambitions as well as about whatever I feel like.

About me
I am Mikko Auvinen. I am currently studying in Laurea University of applied sciences. I am 20 years old and I live very close to my campus.
I started my studies immeadtly after having served in the army. As such, I do not have any meaningful experience in the industry and my skills are limited to what I've learned so far.
